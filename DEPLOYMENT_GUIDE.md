# Deployment Guide - Fixing Vercel Deployment Issues

## Problem Solved
The deployment was failing due to Pillow 10.1.0 compatibility issues with Python 3.13.5. This has been fixed by updating to Pillow 10.4.0.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated requirements.txt
- Updated Pillow from 10.1.0 to 10.4.0
- Added gunicorn==21.2.0 for production server

### 2. Created vercel.json
- Configured proper build settings for Vercel
- Set up routing for Django application

### 3. Created build_files.sh
- Script to handle static file collection
- Database migrations and sample data population

### 4. Updated settings.py
- Added DATABASE_URL support for production databases
- Improved static files configuration for production
- Better environment variable handling

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables
Set these in your Vercel dashboard:

```
SECRET_KEY=your-secure-secret-key-here
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1,your-app.vercel.app
```

### 2. Build Command
In Vercel dashboard, set the build command to:
```bash
chmod +x build_files.sh && ./build_files.sh
```

### 3. Output Directory
Set to: `staticfiles`

### 4. Install Command
Set to: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Alternative: Manual Deployment

If you prefer to deploy manually:

1. **Push the updated code** to your repository
2. **Connect to Vercel** and import your repository
3. **Set environment variables** in Vercel dashboard
4. **Deploy** - the build should now succeed

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get Pillow errors:
1. Try updating to even newer Pillow version:
   ```
   Pillow==10.5.0
   ```

### If you get database errors:
1. Make sure your DATABASE_URL is properly formatted
2. For SQLite (development), leave DATABASE_URL empty

### If static files don't load:
1. Check that STATIC_ROOT is set correctly
2. Ensure build_files.sh has execute permissions
3. Verify static files are being collected

## Production Considerations

1. **Database**: Consider using PostgreSQL for production
2. **Media Files**: Use cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary) for uploaded images
3. **Email**: Configure proper SMTP settings
4. **Security**: Set DEBUG=False and use strong SECRET_KEY

## Success Indicators

After successful deployment, you should see:
- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ Website loads at your Vercel URL
- ✅ Admin panel accessible at `/admin/`
- ✅ Sample data visible on homepage
- ✅ Images and galleries working properly
